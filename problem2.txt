the result is:
sequential-scan = 1.140989s
64 threads used:
parallel-scan   = 0.439317s
error = 0

32 threads used:
parallel-scan   = 0.370656s
error = 0

Note, Since I am using crunchy1, the result is unstable, even for same threads setting the time varys about 0.1 seconds for parrallel-scan. 
But from the result we can see that parallel scan is at least 2 times faster than sequential one.
